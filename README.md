# Probabilistic programming with programmable variational inference
This repository contains the JAX prototype that accompanies the paper [_Probabilistic programming with programmable variational inference_](./pldi24_programmable_vi_original_submit.pdf), as well as the experiments used to generate (some of) the figures in the empirical evaluation section.

## Overview

## Reproducing our results

We've organized the experiments code under the `experiments` directory. The `experiments` directory contains the following subdirectories (which map directly onto the figures in the submitted version of the paper):

* `fig_2_noisy_cone`
* `fig_7_air_estimator_evaluation`
* `table_1_minibatch_gradient_benchmark`
* `table_2_benchmark_timings`
* `table_4_objective_values`

Each directory contains the code used to create an artifact in the submission.
