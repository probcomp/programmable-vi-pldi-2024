    def flatten(self) -> Tuple[Tuple, Tuple]:
        """`flatten` must be implemented when a user mixes `Pytree` into the
        declaration of a new class or dataclass.

        The implementation of `flatten` assumes the following contract:

        * must return a 2-tuple of tuples.
        * the first tuple is "dynamic" data - things that JAX tracers are allowed to population.
        * the second tuple is "static" data - things which are known at JAX tracing time. Static data is also used by JAX for `Pytree` equality comparison.

        For more information, consider [JAX's documentation on Pytrees](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pytrees.html).

        Returns:

            dynamic: Dynamic data which supports JAX tracer values.
            static: Static data which is JAX trace time constant.

        Examples:

            Let's assume that you are implementing a new dataclass. Here's how you would define the dataclass using the `Pytree` mixin.

            ```python
            @dataclass
            class MyFoo(Pytree):
                static_field: Any
                dynamic_field: Any

                # Implementing `flatten`
                def flatten(self):
                    return (self.dynamic_field, ), (self.static_field, )
            ```

            !!! info "Ordering fields in `Pytree` declarations"

                Note that the ordering in the dataclass declaration **does matter** - you should put static fields first. The automatically defined `unflatten` method (c.f. below) assumes this ordering.

            Now, given the declaration, you can use `jax.tree_util` flattening/unflatten functionality.

            ```python exec="yes" source="tabbed-left"
            import genjax
            import jax.tree_util as jtu

            from dataclasses import dataclass

                    return (self.dynamic_field, ), (self.static_field, )

            f = MyFoo(0, 1.0)
            leaves, form = jtu.tree_flatten(f)

            print(console.render(leaves))
            new = jtu.tree_unflatten(form, leaves)
            print(console.render(new))

        `unflatten` allows usage of `jtu.tree_unflatten` to create instances of a declared class that mixes `Pytree` from a `PyTreeDef` for that class and leaf data.

        Examples:

            Our example from `flatten` above also applies here - where we use `jtu.tree_unflatten` to create a new instance of `MyFoo` from a `PyTreeDef` and leaf data.
